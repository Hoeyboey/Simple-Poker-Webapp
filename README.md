Hey! This is a very simple project that allows you to play a form of poker (well, a card game based on the value of cards in your hand and whether you've got pairs, threes, or straights) with up to 25 players on one deck. It's written using AngularJS, primarily, with just the bits in the CSS and HTML to make it functional. The rules for the game are:
 - Each card is worth its face value (Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13
 - A pair gives 10 extra points
 - A three of a kind gives 20 extra points
 - A straight gives 40 extra points
 
Very simple, took a couple of hours to complete. Formatted to the Airbnb JavaScript style guide.
